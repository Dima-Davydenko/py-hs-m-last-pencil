# py-hs-m-last-pencil
This is a medium rate project from Hyperskill "Python Developer" course.

It's a simple game where user plays with bot removing vertical bar symbols representing pencils (for example, |||||| or ||||).

**The rules are following:**
- players can remove not more than 3 pencils at a time.
- the player who takes the last pencil loses the game

**Game flow:**
1. Init number of pencils
2. Init who will make a first move. John for "user" and Jack for bot
3. Make turns till someone lose
